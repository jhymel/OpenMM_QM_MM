OpenMM is a toolkit for molecular simulation. It can be used either as a
    stand-alone application for running simulations, or as a library you call
    from your own code. It provides a combination of extreme flexibility
    (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high performance
    (especially on recent GPUs) that make it truly unique among simulation codes.
