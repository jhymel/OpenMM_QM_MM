%feature("docstring") System "This class represents a molecular system. The definition of a System involves four elements:






The particles and constraints are defined directly by the System object, while forces are defined by objects that extend the Force class. After creating a System, call addParticle() once for each particle, addConstraint() for each constraint, and addForce() for each Force.


In addition, particles may be designated as \"virtual sites\". These are particles whose positions are computed automatically based on the positions of other particles.

%feature("docstring") SerializationNode "A SerializationNode stores information about an object during serialization or deserialization.


When an object is serialized, its SerializationProxy is first called to copy information about the object into a SerializationNode. That information can then be written to the output stream in the desired format.


When an object is deserialized, the input stream is read and the information is stored into a SerializationNode. The appropriate SerializationProxy is then called to reconstruct the object.


SerializationNodes are arranged in a tree. There will often be a one-to-one correspondence between objects and SerializationNodes, but that need not always be true. A proxy is free to create whatever child nodes it wants and store information in them using whatever organization is most convenient.


Each SerializationNode can store an arbitrary set of \"properties\", represented as key-value pairs. The key is always a string, while the value may be a string, an int, or a double. If a value is specified using one data type and then accessed as a different data type, the node will attempt to convert the value in an appropriate way. For example, it is always reasonable to call getStringProperty() to access a property as a string. Similarly, you can use setStringProperty() to specify a property and then access it using getIntProperty(). This will produce the expected result if the original value was, in fact, the string representation of an int, but if the original string was non-numeric, the result is undefined.";

%feature("docstring") CustomCentroidBondForce "This class is similar to CustomCompoundBondForce, but instead of applying forces between individual particles, it applies them between the centers of groups of particles. This is useful for a variety of purposes, such as restraints to keep two molecules from moving too far apart.


When using this class, you define groups of particles, and the center of each group is calculated as a weighted average of the particle positions. By default, the particle masses are used as weights, so the center position is the center of mass. You can optionally specify different weights to use. You then add bonds just as with CustomCompoundBondForce, but instead of specifying the particles that make up a bond, you specify the groups.


When creating a CustomCentroidBondForce, you specify the number of groups involved in a bond, and an expression for the energy of each bond. It may depend on the center positions of individual groups, the distances between the centers of pairs of groups, the angles formed by sets of three groups, and the dihedral angles formed by sets of four groups.


We refer to the groups in a bond as g1, g2, g3, etc. For each bond, CustomCentroidBondForce evaluates a user supplied algebraic expression to determine the interaction energy. The expression may depend on the following variables and functions:

 - x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc.: The x, y, and z coordinates of the centers of the groups. For example, x1 is the x coordinate of the center of group g1, and y3 is the y coordinate of the center of group g3.
 - distance(g1, g2): the distance between the centers of groups g1 and g2 (where \"g1\" and \"g2\" may be replaced by the names of whichever groups you want to calculate the distance between).
 - angle(g1, g2, g3): the angle formed by the centers of the three specified groups.
 - dihedral(g1, g2, g3, g4): the dihedral angle formed by the centers of the four specified groups.

The expression also may involve tabulated functions, and may depend on arbitrary global and per-bond parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomCentroidBondForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy of each bond. Then call addPerBondParameter() to define per-bond parameters and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-bond parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().


Next call addGroup() to define the particle groups. Each group is specified by the particles it contains, and the weights to use when computing the center position.


Then call addBond() to define bonds and specify their parameter values. After a bond has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setBondParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


As an example, the following code creates a CustomCentroidBondForce that implements a harmonic force between the centers of mass of two groups of particles.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomCentroidBondForce* force = new CustomCentroidBondForce(2, \"0.5*k*distance(g1,g2)^2\");
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"k\");
*    force->addGroup(particles1);
*    force->addGroup(particles2);
*    vector<int> bondGroups;
*    bondGroups.push_back(0);
*    bondGroups.push_back(1);
*    vector<double> bondParameters;
*    bondParameters.push_back(k);
*    force->addBond(bondGroups, bondParameters);
*
* </verbatim>


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.


This class also supports the functions pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), pointangle(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3), and pointdihedral(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4). These functions are similar to distance(), angle(), and dihedral(), but the arguments are the coordinates of points to perform the calculation based on rather than the names of groups. This enables more flexible geometric calculations. For example, the following computes the distance from group g1 to the midpoint between groups g2 and g3.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomCentroidBondForce* force = new CustomCentroidBondForce(3, \"pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, (x2+x3)/2, (y2+y3)/2, (z2+z3)/2)\");
*
* </verbatim>

%feature("docstring") GayBerneForce "This class implements the Gay-Berne anisotropic potential. This is similar to a Lennard-Jones potential, but it represents the particles as ellipsoids rather than point particles. In addition to the standard sigma and epsilon parameters, each particle has three widths sx, sy, and sz that give the diameter of the ellipsoid along each axis. It also has three scale factors ex, ey, and ez that scale the strength of the interaction along each axis. You can think of this force as a Lennard-Jones interaction computed based on the distance between the nearest points on two ellipsoids. The scale factors act as multipliers for epsilon along each axis, so the strength of the interaction along the ellipsoid's x axis is multiplied by ex, and likewise for the other axes. If two particles each have all their widths set to sigma and all their scale factors set to 1, the interaction simplifies to a standard Lennard-Jones force between point particles.


The orientation of a particle's ellipsoid is determined based on the positions of two other particles. The vector to the first particle sets the direction of the x axis. The vector to the second particle (after subtracting out any x component) sets the direction of the y axis. If the ellipsoid is axially symmetric (sy=sz and ey=ez), you can omit the second particle and define only an x axis direction. If the ellipsoid is a sphere (all three widths and all three scale factors are equal), both particles can be omitted.


To determine the values of sigma and epsilon for an interaction, this class uses Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules: it takes the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles. You also can specify \"exceptions\", particular pairs of particles for which different values should be used.


To use this class, create a GayBerneForce object, then call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to define its parameters. The number of particles for which you define parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


When using a cutoff, by default interactions are sharply truncated at the cutoff distance. Optionally you can instead use a switching function to make the interaction smoothly go to zero over a finite distance range. To enable this, call setUseSwitchingFunction(). You must also call setSwitchingDistance() to specify the distance at which the interaction should begin to decrease. The switching distance must be less than the cutoff distance.";

%feature("docstring") CustomBondForce "This class implements bonded interactions between pairs of particles. Unlike HarmonicBondForce, the functional form of the interaction is completely customizable, and may involve arbitrary algebraic expressions. It may depend on the distance between particles, as well as on arbitrary global and per-bond parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomBondForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy between each pair of bonded particles. The expression may depend on r, the distance between the particles, as well as on any parameters you choose. Then call addPerBondParameter() to define per-bond parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-bond parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter(). Finally, call addBond() once for each bond. After a bond has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setBondParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


As an example, the following code creates a CustomBondForce that implements a harmonic potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomBondForce* force = new CustomBondForce(\"0.5*k*(r-r0)^2\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on two parameters: the spring constant k and equilibrium distance r0. The following code defines these parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"k\");
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"r0\");
*
* </verbatim>


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.";

%feature("docstring") CustomNonbondedForce "This class implements nonbonded interactions between particles. Unlike NonbondedForce, the functional form of the interaction is completely customizable, and may involve arbitrary algebraic expressions and tabulated functions. It may depend on the distance between particles, as well as on arbitrary global and per-particle parameters. It also optionally supports periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions.


To use this class, create a CustomNonbondedForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy between each pair of particles. The expression may depend on r, the distance between the particles, as well as on any parameters you choose. Then call addPerParticleParameter() to define per-particle parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-particle parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().


Next, call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to set the values of its per-particle parameters. The number of particles for which you set parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


CustomNonbondedForce also lets you specify \"exclusions\", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be omitted from force and energy calculations. This is most often used for particles that are bonded to each other.


As an example, the following code creates a CustomNonbondedForce that implements a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomNonbondedForce* force = new CustomNonbondedForce(\"4*epsilon*((sigma/r)^12-(sigma/r)^6); sigma=0.5*(sigma1+sigma2); epsilon=sqrt(epsilon1*epsilon2)\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on two parameters: sigma and epsilon. The following code defines these as per-particle parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerParticleParameter(\"sigma\");
*    force->addPerParticleParameter(\"epsilon\");
*
* </verbatim>


The expression _must_ be symmetric with respect to the two particles. It typically will only be evaluated once for each pair of particles, and no guarantee is made about which particle will be identified as \"particle 1\". In the above example, the energy only depends on the products sigma1*sigma2 and epsilon1*epsilon2, both of which are unchanged if the labels 1 and 2 are reversed. In contrast, if it depended on the difference sigma1-sigma2, the results would be undefined, because reversing the labels 1 and 2 would change the energy.


CustomNonbondedForce can operate in two modes. By default, it computes the interaction of every particle in the System with every other particle. Alternatively, you can restrict it to only a subset of particle pairs. To do this, specify one or more \"interaction groups\". An interaction group consists of two sets of particles that should interact with each other. Every particle in the first set interacts with every particle in the second set. For example, you might use this feature to compute a solute-solvent interaction energy, while omitting all interactions between two solute atoms or two solvent atoms.


To create an interaction group, call addInteractionGroup(). You may add as many interaction groups as you want. Be aware of the following:

 - Exclusions are still taken into account, so the interactions between excluded pairs are omitted.
 - Likewise, a particle will never interact with itself, even if it appears in both sets of an interaction group.
 - If a particle pair appears in two different interaction groups, its interaction will be computed twice. This is sometimes useful, but be aware of it so you do not accidentally create unwanted duplicate interactions.
 - If you do not add any interaction groups to a CustomNonbondedForce, it operates in the default mode where every particle interacts with every other particle.

When using a cutoff, by default the interaction is sharply truncated at the cutoff distance. Optionally you can instead use a switching function to make the interaction smoothly go to zero over a finite distance range. To enable this, call setUseSwitchingFunction(). You must also call setSwitchingDistance() to specify the distance at which the interaction should begin to decrease. The switching distance must be less than the cutoff distance. Of course, you could also incorporate the switching function directly into your energy expression, but there are several advantages to keeping it separate. It makes your energy expression simpler to write and understand. It allows you to use the same energy expression with or without a cutoff. Also, when using a long range correction (see below), separating out the switching function allows the correction to be calculated more accurately.


Another optional feature of this class is to add a contribution to the energy which approximates the effect of all interactions beyond the cutoff in a periodic system. When running a simulation at constant pressure, this can improve the quality of the result. Call setUseLongRangeCorrection() to enable it.


Computing the long range correction takes negligible work in each time step, but it does require an expensive precomputation at the start of the simulation. Furthermore, that precomputation must be repeated every time a global parameter changes (or when you modify per-particle parameters by calling updateParametersInContext()). This means that if parameters change frequently, the long range correction can be very slow. For this reason, it is disabled by default.


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise. The names of per-particle parameters have the suffix \"1\" or \"2\" appended to them to indicate the values for the two interacting particles. As seen in the above example, the expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using \";\" as a separator.


In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values. You specify the function by creating a TabulatedFunction object. That function can then appear in the expression.";

%feature("docstring") CustomAngleForce "This class implements interactions between sets of three particles that depend on the angle between them. Unlike HarmonicAngleForce, the functional form of the interaction is completely customizable, and may involve arbitrary algebraic expressions. In addition to the angle formed by the particles, it may depend on arbitrary global and per-angle parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomAngleForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy between each set of particles. The expression may depend on theta, the angle formed by the particles, as well as on any parameters you choose. Then call addPerAngleParameter() to define per-angle parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-angle parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter(). Finally, call addAngle() once for each angle. After an angle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setAngleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


As an example, the following code creates a CustomAngleForce that implements a harmonic potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomAngleForce* force = new CustomAngleForce(\"0.5*k*(theta-theta0)^2\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on two parameters: the spring constant k and equilibrium angle theta0. The following code defines these parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerAngleParameter(\"k\");
*    force->addPerAngleParameter(\"theta0\");
*
* </verbatim>


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.";

%feature("docstring") MonteCarloFlexibleBarostat "This class uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to adjust the size and shape of the periodic box, simulating the effect of constant pressure.


This class is similar to MonteCarloBarostat, but it simulates a fully flexible periodic box in which all three lengths and all three angles are free to change independently. It is primarily useful for simulations of bulk materials where the shape of a crystal's unit cell may not be known in advance, or could even change with time as it transitions between phases.


Like MonteCarloBarostat, the default behavior of this class is to scale the centroid position of each molecule while holding it rigid. In simulations of materials where all atoms are covalently bonded to each other, this behavior will not work well since the entire system then consists of a single molecule. You can use setScaleMoleculesAsRigid() to disable this behavior and instead have it scale the position of every atom independently.


This class assumes the simulation is also being run at constant temperature, and requires you to specify the system temperature (since it affects the acceptance probability for Monte Carlo moves). It does not actually perform temperature regulation, however. You must use another mechanism along with it to maintain the temperature, such as LangevinIntegrator or AndersenThermostat.";

This class assumes the simulation is also being run at constant temperature, and requires you to specify the system temperature (since it affects the acceptance probability for Monte Carlo moves).

%feature("docstring") NonbondedForce "This class implements nonbonded interactions between particles, including a Coulomb force to represent electrostatics and a Lennard-Jones force to represent van der Waals interactions. It optionally supports periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions. Lennard-Jones interactions are calculated with the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule: it uses the arithmetic mean of the sigmas and the geometric mean of the epsilons for the two interacting particles.


To use this class, create a NonbondedForce object, then call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to define its parameters. The number of particles for which you define nonbonded parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


NonbondedForce also lets you specify \"exceptions\", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be computed based on different parameters than those defined for the individual particles. This can be used to completely exclude certain interactions from the force calculation, or to alter how they interact with each other.


Many molecular force fields omit Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions between particles separated by one or two bonds, while using modified parameters for those separated by three bonds (known as \"1-4 interactions\"). This class provides a convenience method for this case called createExceptionsFromBonds(). You pass to it a list of bonds and the scale factors to use for 1-4 interactions. It identifies all pairs of particles which are separated by 1, 2, or 3 bonds, then automatically creates exceptions for them.


When using a cutoff, by default Lennard-Jones interactions are sharply truncated at the cutoff distance. Optionally you can instead use a switching function to make the interaction smoothly go to zero over a finite distance range. To enable this, call setUseSwitchingFunction(). You must also call setSwitchingDistance() to specify the distance at which the interaction should begin to decrease. The switching distance must be less than the cutoff distance.


Another optional feature of this class (enabled by default) is to add a contribution to the energy which approximates the effect of all Lennard-Jones interactions beyond the cutoff in a periodic system. When running a simulation at constant pressure, this can improve the quality of the result. Call setUseDispersionCorrection() to set whether this should be used.


In some applications, it is useful to be able to inexpensively change the parameters of small groups of particles. Usually this is done to interpolate between two sets of parameters. For example, a titratable group might have two states it can exist in, each described by a different set of parameters for the atoms that make up the group. You might then want to smoothly interpolate between the two states. This is done by first calling addGlobalParameter() to define a Context parameter, then addParticleParameterOffset() to create a \"parameter offset\" that depends on the Context parameter. Each offset defines the following:

 - A Context parameter used to interpolate between the states.
 - A single particle whose parameters are influenced by the Context parameter.
 - Three scale factors (chargeScale, sigmaScale, and epsilonScale) that specify how the Context parameter affects the particle.

The \"effective\" parameters for a particle (those used to compute forces) are given by


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    charge = baseCharge + param*chargeScale
*    sigma = baseSigma + param*sigmaScale
*    epsilon = baseEpsilon + param*epsilonScale
*
* </verbatim>


where the \"base\" values are the ones specified by addParticle() and \"oaram\" is the current value of the Context parameter. A single Context parameter can apply offsets to multiple particles, and multiple parameters can be used to apply offsets to the same particle. Parameters can also be used to modify exceptions in exactly the same way by calling addExceptionParameterOffset().";

%feature("docstring") CustomHbondForce "This class supports a wide variety of energy functions used to represent hydrogen bonding. It computes interactions between \"donor\" particle groups and \"acceptor\" particle groups, where each group may include up to three particles. Typically a donor group consists of a hydrogen atom and the atoms it is bonded to, and an acceptor group consists of a negatively charged atom and the atoms it is bonded to.


We refer to the particles in a donor group as d1, d2 and d3, and the particles in an acceptor group as a1, a2, and a3. For each donor and each acceptor, CustomHbondForce evaluates a user supplied algebraic expression to determine the interaction energy. The expression may depend on arbitrary distances, angles, and dihedral angles defined by any of the six particles involved. The function distance(p1, p2) is the distance between the particles p1 and p2 (where \"p1\" and \"p2\" should be replaced by the names of the actual particles to calculate the distance between), angle(p1, p2, p3) is the angle formed by the three specified particles, and dihedral(p1, p2, p3, p4) is the dihedral angle formed by the four specified particles.


The expression also may involve tabulated functions, and may depend on arbitrary global, per-donor, and per-acceptor parameters. It also optionally supports periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions.


To use this class, create a CustomHbondForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy between each donor and acceptor. Then call addPerDonorParameter() to define per-donor parameters, addPerAcceptorParameter() to define per-acceptor parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-donor and per-acceptor parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().


Next, call addDonor() and addAcceptor() to define donors and acceptors and specify their parameter values. After a donor or acceptor has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setDonorParameters() or setAcceptorParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


CustomHbondForce also lets you specify \"exclusions\", particular combinations of donors and acceptors whose interactions should be omitted from force and energy calculations. This is most often used for particles that are bonded to each other.


As an example, the following code creates a CustomHbondForce that implements a simple harmonic potential to keep the distance between a1 and d1, and the angle formed by a1-d1-d2, near ideal values:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomHbondForce* force = new CustomHbondForce(\"k*(distance(a1,d1)-r0)^2*(angle(a1,d1,d2)-theta0)^2\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on three parameters: k, r0, and theta0. The following code defines these as per-donor parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerDonorParameter(\"k\");
*    force->addPerDonorParameter(\"r0\");
*    force->addPerDonorParameter(\"theta0\");
*
* </verbatim>


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.


In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values. You specify the function by creating a TabulatedFunction object. That function can then appear in the expression.";

%feature("docstring") RPMDIntegrator "This is an Integrator which simulates a System using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). It simulates many copies of the System, with successive copies connected by harmonic springs to form a ring. This allows certain quantum mechanical effects to be efficiently simulated.


By default this Integrator applies a PILE thermostat to the system to simulate constant temperature dynamics. You can disable the thermostat by calling setApplyThermostat(false).


Because this Integrator simulates many copies of the System at once, it must be used differently from other Integrators. Instead of setting positions and velocities by calling methods of the Context, you should use the corresponding methods of the Integrator to set them for specific copies of the System. Similarly, you should retrieve state information for particular copies by calling getState() on the Integrator. Do not query the Context for state information.


You can optionally specify a set of \"ring polymer contractions\", by which different force groups are evaluated on different numbers of copies, instead of computing every force on every copy. This can be much more efficient, since different forces may vary widely in how many times they must be evaluated to produce sufficient accuracy. For example, you might simulate a 32 copy ring polymer and evaluate bonded forces on every copy, but contract it down to only 6 copies for computing nonbonded interactions, and down to only a single copy (the centroid) for computing the reciprocal space part of PME.";

ydir = w<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub>r<sub>3</sub> + ...


For the origin, the weights must add to one.

The z direction is computed as zdir = xdir x ydir. To ensure the axes are all orthogonal, ydir is then recomputed as ydir = zdir x xdir. All three axis vectors are then normalized, and the virtual site location is set to

%feature("docstring") VariableVerletIntegrator "This is an error controlled, variable time step Integrator that simulates a System using the leap-frog Verlet algorithm. It compares the result of the Verlet integrator to that of an explicit Euler integrator, takes the difference between the two as a measure of the integration error in each time step, and continuously adjusts the step size to keep the error below a specified tolerance. This both improves the stability of the integrator and allows it to take larger steps on average, while still maintaining comparable accuracy to a fixed step size integrator.


It is best not to think of the error tolerance as having any absolute meaning. It is just an adjustable parameter that affects the step size and integration accuracy. You should try different values to find the largest one that produces a trajectory sufficiently accurate for your purposes. 0.001 is often a good starting point.


Unlike a fixed step size Verlet integrator, variable step size Verlet is not symplectic. This means that at a given accuracy level, energy is not as precisely conserved over long time periods. This makes it most appropriate for constant temperate simulations. In constant energy simulations where precise energy conservation over long time periods is important, a fixed step size Verlet integrator may be more appropriate.


You can optionally set a maximum step size it will ever use. This is useful to prevent it from taking excessively large steps in usual situations, such as when the system is right at a local energy minimum.";

%feature("docstring") CustomExternalForce "This class implements an \"external\" force on particles. The force may be applied to any subset of the particles in the System. The force on each particle is specified by an arbitrary algebraic expression, which may depend on the current position of the particle as well as on arbitrary global and per-particle parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomExternalForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the potential energy of each affected particle. The expression may depend on the particle's x, y, and z coordinates, as well as on any parameters you choose. Then call addPerParticleParameter() to define per-particle parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-particle parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter(). Finally, call addParticle() once for each particle that should be affected by the force. After a particle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


As an example, the following code creates a CustomExternalForce that attracts each particle to a target position (x0, y0, z0) via a harmonic potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomExternalForce* force = new CustomExternalForce(\"k*((x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2+(z-z0)^2)\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on four parameters: the spring constant k and equilibrium coordinates x0, y0, and z0. The following code defines these parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addGlobalParameter(\"k\", 100.0);
*    force->addPerParticleParameter(\"x0\");
*    force->addPerParticleParameter(\"y0\");
*    force->addPerParticleParameter(\"z0\");
*
* </verbatim>


Special care is needed in systems that use periodic boundary conditions. In that case, each particle really represents an infinite set of particles repeating through space. The variables x, y, and z contain the coordinates of one of those periodic copies, but there is no guarantee about which. It might even change from one time step to the next. You can handle this situation by using the function periodicdistance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), which returns the minimum distance between periodic copies of the points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2). For example, the force given above would be rewritten as


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomExternalForce* force = new CustomExternalForce(\"k*periodicdistance(x, y, z, x0, y0, z0)^2\");
*
* </verbatim>


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.";

%feature("docstring") AmoebaVdwForce "This class models van der Waals forces in the AMOEBA force field. It can use either buffered 14-7 potential or a Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential.


This class can operate in two different modes. In one mode, force field parameters are defined for each particle. When two particles interact, a combining rule is used to calculate the interaction parameters based on the parameters for the two particles. To use the class in this mode, call the version of addParticle() that takes sigma and epsilon values. It should be called once for each particle in the System.


In the other mode, each particle has a type index, and parameters are specified for each type rather than each individual particle. By default this mode also uses a combining rule, but you can override it by defining alternate parameters to use for specific pairs of particle types. To use the class in this mode, call the version of addParticle() that takes a type index. It should be called once for each particle in the System. You also must call addParticleType() once for each type. If you wish to override the combining for particular pairs of types, do so by calling addTypePair().


A unique feature of this class is that the interaction site for a particle does not need to be exactly at the particle's location. Instead, it can be placed a fraction of the distance from that particle to another one. This is typically done for hydrogens to place the interaction site slightly closer to the parent atom. The fraction is known as the \"reduction factor\", since it reduces the distance from the parent atom to the interaction site.


Support is also available for softcore interactions based on setting a per particle alchemical flag and setting the AmoebaVdwForce to use an \"AlchemicalMethod\"  either Decouple or Annihilate. For Decouple, two alchemical atoms interact normally. For Annihilate, all interactions involving an alchemical atom are influenced. The softcore state is specified by setting a single Context parameter \"AmoebaVdwLambda\" between 0.0 and 1.0.


The softcore functional form can be modified by setting the softcore power (default of 5) and the softcore alpha (default of 0,7). For more information on the softcore functional form see Eq. 2 from: Jiao, D.; Golubkov, P. A.; Darden, T.

%feature("docstring") MonteCarloMembraneBarostat "This is a Monte Carlo barostat designed specifically for membrane simulations. It assumes the membrane lies in the XY plane. The Monte Carlo acceptance criterion includes a term to model isotropic pressure, which depends on the volume of the periodic box, and a second term to model surface tension, which depends on the cross sectional area of the box in the XY plane. Note that pressure and surface tension are defined with opposite senses: a larger pressure tends to make the box smaller, but a larger surface tension tends to make the box larger.


There are options for configuring exactly how the various box dimensions are allowed to change:

 - The X and Y axes may be treated isotropically, in which case they always scale by the same amount and remain in proportion to each other; or they may be treated anisotropically, in which case they can vary independently of each other.
 - The Z axis can be allowed to vary independently of the other axes; or held fixed; or constrained to vary in inverse proportion to the other two axes, so that the total box volume remains fixed.

This class assumes the simulation is also being run at constant temperature, and requires you to specify the system temperature (since it affects the acceptance probability for Monte Carlo moves). It does not actually perform temperature regulation, however. You must use another mechanism along with it to maintain the temperature, such as LangevinIntegrator or AndersenThermostat.";

%feature("docstring") CustomTorsionForce "This class implements interactions between sets of four particles that depend on the torsion angle between them. Unlike PeriodicTorsionForce, the functional form of the interaction is completely customizable, and may involve arbitrary algebraic expressions. In addition to the angle formed by the particles, it may depend on arbitrary global and per-torsion parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomTorsionForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy between each set of particles. The expression may depend on theta, the torsion angle formed by the particles, as well as on any parameters you choose. Then call addPerTorsionParameter() to define per-torsion parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-torsion parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter(). Finally, call addTorsion() once for each torsion. After an torsion has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setTorsionParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext(). Note that theta is guaranteed to be in the range [-pi,+pi], which may cause issues with force discontinuities if the energy function does not respect this domain.


As an example, the following code creates a CustomTorsionForce that implements a periodic potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomTorsionForce* force = new CustomTorsionForce(\"0.5*k*(1-cos(theta-theta0))\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on two parameters: the spring constant k and equilibrium angle theta0. The following code defines these parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerTorsionParameter(\"k\");
*    force->addPerTorsionParameter(\"theta0\");
*
* </verbatim>


If a harmonic restraint is desired, it is important to be careful of the domain for theta, using an idiom like this:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomTorsionForce* force = new CustomTorsionForce(\"0.5*k*min(dtheta, 2*pi-dtheta)^2; dtheta = abs(theta-theta0); pi = 3.1415926535\");
*
* </verbatim>


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.";

<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*     Context context(system, compoundIntegrator);
*

Finally, call setCurrentIntegrator() to set which Integrator is active. That one will be used for all calls to step() until the next time you change it.

*

When switching between integrators, it is important to make sure they are compatible with each other, and that they will interpret the positions and velocities in the same way. Remember that leapfrog style integrators assume the positions and velocities are offset from each other by half a time step. When switching between a leapfrog and non-leapfrog integrator, you must first adjust the velocities to avoid introducing error. This is also true when switching between two leapfrog integrators that use different step sizes, since they will interpret the velocities as corresponding to different times.";

%feature("docstring") CustomGBForce "This class implements complex, multiple stage nonbonded interactions between particles. It is designed primarily for implementing Generalized Born implicit solvation models, although it is not strictly limited to that purpose. The interaction is specified as a series of computations, each defined by an arbitrary algebraic expression. It also allows tabulated functions to be defined and used with the computations. It optionally supports periodic boundary conditions and cutoffs for long range interactions.


The computation consists of calculating some number of per-particle _computed values_, followed by one or more _energy terms_. A computed value is a scalar value that is computed for each particle in the system. It may depend on an arbitrary set of global and per-particle parameters, and well as on other computed values that have been calculated before it. Once all computed values have been calculated, the energy terms and their derivatives are evaluated to determine the system energy and particle forces. The energy terms may depend on global parameters, per-particle parameters, and per-particle computed values.


When specifying a computed value or energy term, you provide an algebraic expression to evaluate and a _computation type_ describing how the expression is to be evaluated. There are two main types of computations:

 - *Single Particle*: The expression is evaluated once for each particle in the System. In the case of a computed value, this means the value for a particle depends only on other properties of that particle (its position, parameters, and other computed values). In the case of an energy term, it means each particle makes an independent contribution to the System energy.
 - *Particle Pairs*: The expression is evaluated for every pair of particles in the system. In the case of a computed value, the value for a particular particle is calculated by pairing it with every other particle in the system, evaluating the expression for each pair, and summing them. For an energy term, each particle pair makes an independent contribution to the System energy. (Note that energy terms are assumed to be symmetric with respect to the two interacting particles, and therefore are evaluated only once per pair. In contrast, expressions for computed values need not be symmetric and therefore are calculated twice for each pair: once when calculating the value for the first particle, and again when calculating the value for the second particle.)

Be aware that, although this class is extremely general in the computations it can define, particular Platforms may only support more restricted types of computations. In particular, all currently existing Platforms require that the first computed value _must_ be a particle pair computation, and all computed values after the first _must_ be single particle computations. This is sufficient for most Generalized Born models, but might not permit some other types of calculations to be implemented.


This is a complicated class to use, and an example may help to clarify it. The following code implements the OBC variant of the GB/SA solvation model, using the ACE approximation to estimate surface area:

It begins by defining three per-particle parameters (charge, atomic radius, and scale factor) and two global parameters (the dielectric constants for the solute and solvent). It then defines a computed value \"I\" of type ParticlePair. The expression for evaluating it is a complicated function of the distance between each pair of particles (r), their atomic radii (radius1 and radius2), and their scale factors (scale1 and scale2). Very roughly speaking, it is a measure of the distance between each particle and other nearby particles.


Next a computation is defined for the Born Radius (B). It is computed independently for each particle, and is a function of that particle's atomic radius and the intermediate value I defined above.


Finally, two energy terms are defined. The first one is computed for each particle and represents the surface area term, as well as the self interaction part of the polarization energy. The second term is calculated for each pair of particles, and represents the screening of electrostatic interactions by the solvent.


After defining the force as shown above, you should then call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to set the values of its per-particle parameters (q, radius, and scale). The number of particles for which you set parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


CustomGBForce also lets you specify \"exclusions\", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be omitted from calculations. This is most often used for particles that are bonded to each other. Even if you specify exclusions, however, you can use the computation type ParticlePairNoExclusions to indicate that exclusions should not be applied to a particular piece of the computation.


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise. In expressions for particle pair calculations, the names of per-particle parameters and computed values have the suffix \"1\" or \"2\" appended to them to indicate the values for the two interacting particles. As seen in the above example, an expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using \";\" as a separator.


In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values. You specify the function by creating a TabulatedFunction object. That function can then appear in expressions.";

To use it, you define a set of collective variables (scalar valued functions that depend on the particle positions), and an algebraic expression for the energy as a function of the collective variables.

Each collective variable is defined by a Force object. The Force's potential energy is computed, and that becomes the value of the variable. This provides enormous flexibility in defining collective variables, especially by using custom forces. Anything that can be computed as a potential function can also be used as a collective variable.


To use this class, create a CustomCVForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the potential energy. Then call addCollectiveVariable() to define collective variables and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().

%feature("docstring") OpenMM::CustomCVForce::getInnerContext "Get the inner Context used for evaluating collective variables.

When you create a Context for a System that contains a CustomCVForce, internally it creates a new System, adds the Forces that define the CVs to it, creates a new Context for that System, and uses it to evaluate the variables. In most cases you can ignore all of this. It is just an implementation detail. However, there are a few cases where you need to directly access that internal Context. For example, if you want to modify one of the Forces that defines a collective variable and call updateParametersInContext() on it, you need to pass that inner Context to it. This method returns a reference to it.

This method is very limited. The only information it updates is the parameters of tabulated functions. All other aspects of the Force (the energy expression, the set of collective variables, etc.) are unaffected and can only be changed by reinitializing the Context.";

%feature("docstring") CustomIntegrator "This is an Integrator that can be used to implemented arbitrary, user defined integration algorithms. It is flexible enough to support a wide range of methods including both deterministic and stochastic integrators, Metropolized integrators, and integrators that must integrate additional quantities along with the particle positions and momenta.


To create an integration algorithm, you first define a set of variables the integrator will compute. Variables come in two types: global variables have a single value, while per-DOF variables have a value for every degree of freedom (x, y, or z coordinate of a particle). You can define as many variables as you want of each type. The value of any variable can be computed by the integration algorithm, or set directly by calling a method on the CustomIntegrator. All variables are persistent between integration steps; once a value is set, it keeps that value until it is changed by the user or recomputed in a later integration step.


Next, you define the algorithm as a series of computations. To execute a time step, the integrator performs the list of computations in order. Each computation updates the value of one global or per-DOF value. There are several types of computations that can be done:

 - Global: You provide a mathematical expression involving only global variables. It is evaluated and stored into a global variable.
 - Per-DOF: You provide a mathematical expression involving both global and per-DOF variables. It is evaluated once for every degree of freedom, and the values are stored into a per-DOF variable.
 - Sum: You provide a mathematical expression involving both global and per-DOF variables. It is evaluated once for every degree of freedom. All of those values are then added together, and the sum is stored into a global variable.
 - Constrain Positions: The particle positions are updated so that all distance constraints are satisfied.
 - Constrain Velocities: The particle velocities are updated so the net velocity along any constrained distance is 0.

Like all integrators, CustomIntegrator ignores any particle whose mass is 0. It is skipped when doing per-DOF computations, and is not included when computing sums over degrees of freedom.


In addition to the variables you define by calling addGlobalVariable() and addPerDofVariable(), the integrator provides the following pre-defined variables:

 - dt: (global) This is the step size being used by the integrator.
 - energy: (global, read-only) This is the current potential energy of the system.
 - energy0, energy1, energy2, ...: (global, read-only) This is similar to energy, but includes only the contribution from forces in one force group. A single computation step may only depend on a single energy variable (energy, energy0, energy1, etc.).
 - x: (per-DOF) This is the current value of the degree of freedom (the x, y, or z coordinate of a particle).
 - v: (per-DOF) This is the current velocity associated with the degree of freedom (the x, y, or z component of a particle's velocity).
 - f: (per-DOF, read-only) This is the current force acting on the degree of freedom (the x, y, or z component of the force on a particle).
 - f0, f1, f2, ...: (per-DOF, read-only) This is similar to f, but includes only the contribution from forces in one force group. A single computation step may only depend on a single force variable (f, f0, f1, etc.).
 - m: (per-DOF, read-only) This is the mass of the particle the degree of freedom is associated with.
 - uniform: (either global or per-DOF, read-only) This is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. Every time an expression is evaluated, a different value will be used. When used in a per-DOF expression, a different value will be used for every degree of freedom. Note, however, that if this variable appears multiple times in a single expression, the same value is used everywhere it appears in that expression.
 - gaussian: (either global or per-DOF, read-only) This is a Gaussian distributed random number with mean 0 and variance 1. Every time an expression is evaluated, a different value will be used. When used in a per-DOF expression, a different value will be used for every degree of freedom. Note, however, that if this variable appears multiple times in a single expression, the same value is used everywhere it appears in that expression.
 - A global variable is created for every adjustable parameter defined in the integrator's Context.

The following example uses a CustomIntegrator to implement a velocity Verlet integrator:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomIntegrator integrator(0.001);
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f/m\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x+dt*v\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f/m\");
*
* </verbatim>


The first step updates the velocities based on the current forces. The second step updates the positions based on the new velocities, and the third step updates the velocities again. Although the first and third steps look identical, the forces used in them are different. You do not need to tell the integrator that; it will recognize that the positions have changed and know to recompute the forces automatically.


The above example has two problems. First, it does not respect distance constraints. To make the integrator work with constraints, you need to add extra steps to tell it when and how to apply them. Second, it never gives Forces an opportunity to update the context state. This should be done every time step so that, for example, an AndersenThermostat can randomize velocities or a MonteCarloBarostat can scale particle positions. You need to add a step to tell the integrator when to do this. The following example corrects both these problems, using the RATTLE algorithm to apply constraints:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomIntegrator integrator(0.001);
*    integrator.addPerDofVariable(\"x1\", 0);
*    integrator.addUpdateContextState();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f/m\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x+dt*v\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x1\", \"x\");
*    integrator.addConstrainPositions();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f/m+(x-x1)/dt\");
*    integrator.addConstrainVelocities();
*
* </verbatim>


CustomIntegrator can be used to implement multiple time step integrators. The following example shows an r-RESPA integrator. It assumes the quickly changing forces are in force group 0 and the slowly changing ones are in force group 1. It evaluates the \"fast\" forces four times as often as the \"slow\" forces.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomIntegrator integrator(0.004);
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f1/m\");
*    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
*        integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*(dt/4)*f0/m\");
*        integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x+(dt/4)*v\");
*        integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*(dt/4)*f0/m\");
*    }
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+0.5*dt*f1/m\");
*
* </verbatim>


The sequence of computations in a CustomIntegrator can include flow control in the form of \"if\" and \"while\" blocks. The computations inside an \"if\" block are executed either zero or one times, depending on whether a condition is true. The computations inside a \"while\" block are executed repeatedly for as long as the condition remains true. Be very careful when writing \"while\" blocks; there is nothing to stop you from creating an infinite loop!


For example, suppose you are writing a Monte Carlo algorithm. Assume you have already computed a new set of particle coordinates \"xnew\" and a step acceptance probability \"acceptanceProbability\". The following lines use an \"if\" block to decide whether to accept the step, and if it is accepted, store the new positions into \"x\".


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    integrator.beginIfBlock(\"uniform < acceptanceProbability\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"xnew\");
*    integrator.endBlock();
*
* </verbatim>


The condition in an \"if\" or \"while\" block is evaluated globally, so it may only involve global variables, not per-DOF ones. It may use any of the following comparison operators: =, <. >, !=, <=, >=. Blocks may be nested inside each other.


\"Per-DOF\" computations can also be thought of as per-particle computations that operate on three component vectors. For example, \"x+dt*v\" means to take the particle's velocity (a vector), multiply it by the step size, and add the position (also a vector). The result is a new vector that can be stored into a per-DOF variable with addComputePerDof(), or it can be summed over all components of all particles with addComputeSum(). Because the calculation is done on vectors, you can use functions that operate explicitly on vectors rather than just computing each component independently. For example, the following line uses a cross product to compute the angular momentum of each particle and stores it into a per-DOF variable.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"angularMomentum\", \"m*cross(x, v)\");
*
* </verbatim>


Here are two more examples that may be useful as starting points for writing your own integrators. The first one implements the algorithm used by the standard VerletIntegrator class. This is a leapfrog algorithm, in contrast to the velocity Verlet algorithm shown above, so it only requires applying constraints once in each time step.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomIntegrator integrator(dt);
*    integrator.addPerDofVariable(\"x0\", 0);
*    integrator.addUpdateContextState();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x0\", \"x\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v+dt*f/m\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x+dt*v\");
*    integrator.addConstrainPositions();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"(x-x0)/dt\");
*
* </verbatim>


The second one implements the algorithm used by the standard LangevinMiddleIntegrator class. kB is Boltzmann's constant.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomIntegrator integrator(dt);
*    integrator.addGlobalVariable(\"a\", exp(-friction*dt));
*    integrator.addGlobalVariable(\"b\", sqrt(1-exp(-2*friction*dt)));
*    integrator.addGlobalVariable(\"kT\", kB*temperature);
*    integrator.addPerDofVariable(\"x1\", 0);
*    integrator.addUpdateContextState();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v + dt*f/m\");
*    integrator.addConstrainVelocities();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x + 0.5*dt*v\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"a*v + b*sqrt(kT/m)*gaussian\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x\", \"x + 0.5*dt*v\");
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"x1\", \"x\");
*    integrator.addConstrainPositions();
*    integrator.addComputePerDof(\"v\", \"v + (x-x1)/dt\");
*
* </verbatim>


Another feature of CustomIntegrator is that it can use derivatives of the potential energy with respect to context parameters. These derivatives are typically computed by custom forces, and are only computed if a Force object has been specifically told to compute them by calling addEnergyParameterDerivative() on it. CustomIntegrator provides a deriv() function for accessing these derivatives in global or per-DOF expressions. For example, \"deriv(energy, lambda)\" is the derivative of the total potentially energy with respect to the parameter lambda. You can also restrict it to a single force group by specifying a different variable for the first argument, such as \"deriv(energy1, lambda)\".


An Integrator has one other job in addition to evolving the equations of motion: it defines how to compute the kinetic energy of the system. Depending on the integration method used, simply summing (mv^2)/2 over all degrees of freedom may not give the correct answer. For example, in a leapfrog integrator the velocities are \"delayed\" by half a time step, so the above formula would give the kinetic energy half a time step ago, not at the current time.


Call setKineticEnergyExpression() to set an expression for the kinetic energy. It is computed for every degree of freedom (excluding ones whose mass is 0) and the result is summed. The default expression is \"m*v*v/2\", which is correct for many integrators.


As example, the following line defines the correct way to compute kinetic energy when using a leapfrog algorithm:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    integrator.setKineticEnergyExpression(\"m*v1*v1/2; v1=v+0.5*dt*f/m\");
*
* </verbatim>


The kinetic energy expression may depend on the following pre-defined variables: x, v, f, m, dt. It also may depend on user-defined global and per-DOF variables, and on the values of adjustable parameters defined in the integrator's Context. It may not depend on any other variable, such as the potential energy, the force from a single force group, or a random number.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise. An expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using \";\" as a separator.


Expressions used in ComputePerDof and ComputeSum steps can also use the following functions that operate on vectors: cross(a, b) is the cross product of two vectors; dot(a, b) is the dot product of two vectors; _x(a), _y(a), and _z(a) extract a single component from a vector; and vector(a, b, c) creates a new vector with the x component of the first argument, the y component of the second argument, and the z component of the third argument. Remember that every quantity appearing in a vector expression is a vector. Functions that appear to return a scalar really return a vector whose components are all the same. For example, _z(a) returns the vector (a.z, a.z, a.z). Likewise, wherever a constant appears in the expression, it really means a vector whose components all have the same value.


In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values. You specify the function by creating a TabulatedFunction object. That function can then appear in expressions.";

%feature("docstring") CustomManyParticleForce "This class supports a wide variety of nonbonded N-particle interactions, where N is user specified. The interaction energy is determined by an arbitrary, user specified algebraic expression that is evaluated for every possible set of N particles in the system. It may depend on the positions of the individual particles, the distances between pairs of particles, the angles formed by sets of three particles, and the dihedral angles formed by sets of four particles.


Be aware that the cost of evaluating an N-particle interaction increases very rapidly with N. Values larger than N=3 are rarely used.


We refer to a set of particles for which the energy is being evaluated as p1, p2, p3, etc. The energy expression may depend on the following variables and functions:

 - x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc.: The x, y, and z coordinates of the particle positions. For example, x1 is the x coordinate of particle p1, and y3 is the y coordinate of particle p3.
 - distance(p1, p2): the distance between particles p1 and p2 (where \"p1\" and \"p2\" may be replaced by the names of whichever particles you want to calculate the distance between).
 - angle(p1, p2, p3): the angle formed by the three specified particles.
 - dihedral(p1, p2, p3, p4): the dihedral angle formed by the four specified particles.
 - arbitrary global and per-particle parameters that you define.

To use this class, create a CustomManyParticleForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy of each set of particles. Then call addPerParticleParameter() to define per-particle parameters, and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-particle parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().


Next, call addParticle() once for each particle in the System to set the values of its per-particle parameters. The number of particles for which you set parameters must be exactly equal to the number of particles in the System, or else an exception will be thrown when you try to create a Context. After a particle has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setParticleParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


Multi-particle interactions can be very expensive to evaluate, so they are usually used with a cutoff distance. The exact interpretation of the cutoff depends on the permutation mode, as discussed below.


CustomManyParticleForce also lets you specify \"exclusions\", particular pairs of particles whose interactions should be omitted from force and energy calculations. This is most often used for particles that are bonded to each other. If you specify a pair of particles as an exclusion, _all_ sets that include those two particles will be omitted.


As an example, the following code creates a CustomManyParticleForce that implements an Axilrod-Teller potential. This is an interaction between three particles that depends on all three distances and angles formed by the particles.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomManyParticleForce* force = new CustomManyParticleForce(3,
*        \"C*(1+3*cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*cos(theta3))/(r12*r13*r23)^3;\"
*        \"theta1=angle(p1,p2,p3); theta2=angle(p2,p3,p1); theta3=angle(p3,p1,p2);\"
*        \"r12=distance(p1,p2); r13=distance(p1,p3); r23=distance(p2,p3)\");
*    force->setPermutationMode(CustomManyParticleForce::SinglePermutation);
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on one parameter, C. The following code defines it as a global parameter:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addGlobalParameter(\"C\", 1.0);
*
* </verbatim>


Notice that the expression is symmetric with respect to the particles. It only depends on the products cos(theta1)*cos(theta2)*cos(theta3) and r12*r13*r23, both of which are unchanged if the labels p1, p2, and p3 are permuted. This is required because we specified SinglePermutation as the permutation mode. (This is the default, so we did not really need to set it, but doing so makes the example clearer.) In this mode, the expression is only evaluated once for each set of particles. No guarantee is made about which particle will be identified as p1, p2, etc. Therefore, the energy _must_ be symmetric with respect to exchange of particles. Otherwise, the results would be undefined because permuting the labels would change the energy.


Not all many-particle interactions work this way. Another common pattern is for the expression to describe an interaction between one central particle and other nearby particles. An example of this is the 3-particle piece of the Stillinger-Weber potential:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomManyParticleForce* force = new CustomManyParticleForce(3,
*        \"L*eps*(cos(theta1)+1/3)^2*exp(sigma*gamma/(r12-a*sigma))*exp(sigma*gamma/(r13-a*sigma));\"
*        \"r12 = distance(p1,p2); r13 = distance(p1,p3); theta1 = angle(p3,p1,p2)\");
*    force->setPermutationMode(CustomManyParticleForce::UniqueCentralParticle);
*
* </verbatim>


When the permutation mode is set to UniqueCentralParticle, particle p1 is treated as the central particle. For a set of N particles, the expression is evaluated N times, once with each particle as p1. The expression can therefore treat p1 differently from the other particles. Notice that it is still symmetric with respect to p2 and p3, however. There is no guarantee about how those labels will be assigned to particles.


Distance cutoffs are applied in different ways depending on the permutation mode. In SinglePermutation mode, every particle in the set must be within the cutoff distance of every other particle. If _any_ two particles are further apart than the cutoff distance, the interaction is skipped. In UniqueCentralParticle mode, each particle must be within the cutoff distance of the central particle, but not necessarily of all the other particles. The cutoff may therefore exclude a subset of the permutations of a set of particles.


Another common situation is that some particles are fundamentally different from others, causing the expression to be inherently non-symmetric. An example would be a water model that involves three particles, two of which _must_ be hydrogen and one of which _must_ be oxygen. Cases like this can be implemented using particle types.


A particle type is an integer that you specify when you call addParticle(). (If you omit the argument, it defaults to 0.) For the water model, you could specify 0 for all oxygen atoms and 1 for all hydrogen atoms. You can then call setTypeFilter() to specify the list of allowed types for each of the N particles involved in an interaction:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    set&lt;int&gt; oxygenTypes, hydrogenTypes;
*    oxygenTypes.insert(0);
*    hydrogenTypes.insert(1);
*    force->setTypeFilter(0, oxygenTypes);
*    force->setTypeFilter(1, hydrogenTypes);
*    force->setTypeFilter(2, hydrogenTypes);
*
* </verbatim>


This specifies that of the three particles in an interaction, p1 must be oxygen while p2 and p3 must be hydrogen. The energy expression will only be evaluated for triplets of particles that satisfy those requirements. It will still only be evaluated once for each triplet, so it must still be symmetric with respect to p2 and p3.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise. The names of per-particle parameters have the suffix \"1\", \"2\", etc. appended to them to indicate the values for the multiple interacting particles. For example, if you define a per-particle parameter called \"charge\", then the variable \"charge2\" is the charge of particle p2. As seen above, the expression may also involve intermediate quantities that are defined following the main expression, using \";\" as a separator.


This class also supports the functions pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), pointangle(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3), and pointdihedral(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4). These functions are similar to distance(), angle(), and dihedral(), but the arguments are the coordinates of points to perform the calculation based on rather than the names of particles. This enables more flexible geometric calculations. For example, the following computes the distance from particle p1 to the midpoint between particles p2 and p3.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomManyParticleForce* force = new CustomManyParticleForce(3, \"pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, (x2+x3)/2, (y2+y3)/2, (z2+z3)/2)\");
*
* </verbatim>


In addition, you can call addTabulatedFunction() to define a new function based on tabulated values. You specify the function by creating a TabulatedFunction object. That function can then appear in the expression.";

Returns

bool

%feature("docstring") CustomCompoundBondForce "This class supports a wide variety of bonded interactions. It defines a \"bond\" as a single energy term that depends on the positions of a fixed set of particles. The number of particles involved in a bond, and how the energy depends on their positions, is configurable. It may depend on the positions of individual particles, the distances between pairs of particles, the angles formed by sets of three particles, and the dihedral angles formed by sets of four particles.


We refer to the particles in a bond as p1, p2, p3, etc. For each bond, CustomCompoundBondForce evaluates a user supplied algebraic expression to determine the interaction energy. The expression may depend on the following variables and functions:

 - x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc.: The x, y, and z coordinates of the particle positions. For example, x1 is the x coordinate of particle p1, and y3 is the y coordinate of particle p3.
 - distance(p1, p2): the distance between particles p1 and p2 (where \"p1\" and \"p2\" may be replaced by the names of whichever particles you want to calculate the distance between).
 - angle(p1, p2, p3): the angle formed by the three specified particles.
 - dihedral(p1, p2, p3, p4): the dihedral angle formed by the four specified particles, guaranteed to be in the range [-pi,+pi].

The expression also may involve tabulated functions, and may depend on arbitrary global and per-bond parameters.


To use this class, create a CustomCompoundBondForce object, passing an algebraic expression to the constructor that defines the interaction energy of each bond. Then call addPerBondParameter() to define per-bond parameters and addGlobalParameter() to define global parameters. The values of per-bond parameters are specified as part of the system definition, while values of global parameters may be modified during a simulation by calling Context::setParameter().


Next, call addBond() to define bonds and specify their parameter values. After a bond has been added, you can modify its parameters by calling setBondParameters(). This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you call updateParametersInContext().


As an example, the following code creates a CustomCompoundBondForce that implements a Urey-Bradley potential. This is an interaction between three particles that depends on the angle formed by p1-p2-p3, and on the distance between p1 and p3.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomCompoundBondForce* force = new CustomCompoundBondForce(3, \"0.5*(kangle*(angle(p1,p2,p3)-theta0)^2+kbond*(distance(p1,p3)-r0)^2)\");
*
* </verbatim>


This force depends on four parameters: kangle, kbond, theta0, and r0. The following code defines these as per-bond parameters:


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"kangle\");
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"kbond\");
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"theta0\");
*    force->addPerBondParameter(\"r0\");
*
* </verbatim>


This class also has the ability to compute derivatives of the potential energy with respect to global parameters. Call addEnergyParameterDerivative() to request that the derivative with respect to a particular parameter be computed. You can then query its value in a Context by calling getState() on it.


Expressions may involve the operators + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and ^ (power), and the following functions: sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, sec, csc, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, erf, erfc, min, max, abs, floor, ceil, step, delta, select. All trigonometric functions are defined in radians, and log is the natural logarithm. step(x) = 0 if x is less than 0, 1 otherwise. delta(x) = 1 if x is 0, 0 otherwise. select(x,y,z) = z if x = 0, y otherwise.


This class also supports the functions pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), pointangle(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3), and pointdihedral(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4). These functions are similar to distance(), angle(), and dihedral(), but the arguments are the coordinates of points to perform the calculation based on rather than the names of particles. This enables more flexible geometric calculations. For example, the following computes the distance from particle p1 to the midpoint between particles p2 and p3.


<verbatim>embed:rst:leading-asterisk
* .. code-block:: cpp
*
*    CustomCompoundBondForce* force = new CustomCompoundBondForce(3, \"pointdistance(x1, y1, z1, (x2+x3)/2, (y2+y3)/2, (z2+z3)/2)\");
*
* </verbatim>
